<!-- question number ONE -->
What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

<!-- answer of the question number ONE -->
getElementById() select one single element through elements id. It only works with id of a component. 
getElementsByClassName() select multiple elements through class name. like couple of elements have same class and it will work for all of these.
querySelector() select the first matching element. It can be selected via id, class or tag.
querySelectorAll() select all matching elements. Selected via css class. It returns a nodelist.
